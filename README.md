# Recurring Transaction Analyzer

A Python application that helps you identify and manage recurring transactions from your credit card statements. The analyzer supports both CSV and PDF formats, with CSV being the recommended format for better accuracy and performance.

## Features

- Parse credit card statements (CSV recommended, PDF supported)
- Identify recurring transactions and subscriptions
- Calculate potential monthly savings
- Provide direct cancellation links for 100+ popular services
- Smart web search for unknown subscription services
- User-friendly GUI interface with sortable columns
- Support for multiple credit card formats (Amex, Chase, etc.)

## Why CSV?

We recommend using CSV files because they:
- Are more reliable to parse than PDFs
- Provide cleaner transaction data
- Process faster than PDFs
- Can be easily exported from most credit card websites
- Maintain consistent formatting

## Note

While we support both CSV and PDF files, we strongly recommend using CSV format for the best experience. PDF parsing can be unreliable due to varying formats and layouts across different statement types and time periods.
